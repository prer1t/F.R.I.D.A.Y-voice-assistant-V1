# F.R.I.D.A.Y-voice-assistant-V1
code for creating your very own voice command assistant for your device just like JARVIS . by using basic stuff like IF ELSE statements and libraries like speech recognition , gtts 


you would need to install some libraries for runnning this code:

* SpeechRecognition (please note that this is case sensitive if you are pip installing )
* pyglet
*pyaudio
* gtts

after installing these you are good to go 
please make sure to follow if you find it satisfying and also do feel free to ask any query in case of any problem.

thank you
